Flask-Whooshee
==============

.. module:: flask_whooshee

*Customizable Flask-SQLAlchemy - Whoosh Integration*

Flask-Whooshee provides more advanced Whoosh integration into Flask.
Its main power is in the ability to index and search joined queries.


Installation
------------

Install the extension with one of the following commands::

    $ easy_install Flask-Whooshee

or alternatively if you have pip installed::

    $ pip install Flask-Whooshee


Set Up
------

Flask-Whooshee supports two different methods of setting up the extension.
You can either initialize it directly, thus binding it to a specific
application instance::

        app = Flask(__name__)
        whooshee = Whooshee(app)

and the second is to use the factory pattern which will allow you to
configure whooshee at a later point::

        whooshee = Whooshee()
        def create_app():
            app = Flask(__name__)
            whooshee.init_app(app)
            return app

Following configuration options are available:

+------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Option                       | Description                                                           |
+==============================+=======================================================================+
| ``WHOOSHEE_DIR``             | The path for the whoosh index (defaults to **whooshee**)              |
+------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``WHOOSHEE_MIN_STRING_LEN``  | Min. characters for the search string (defaults to **3**)             |
+------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``WHOOSHEE_MEMORY_STORAGE``  | Use the memory as storage. Useful for tests. (defaults to **False**)  |
+------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``WHOOSHEE_ENABLE_INDEXING`` | Specify whether or not to actually do any operations with the Whoosh  |
|                              | index (defaults to **True**).                                         |
+------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. versionadded:: 0.4.0
    It's now possible to register whoosheers before calling ``init_app``.

    For example::

        db = SQLAlchemy()
        # we don't pass app, but call init_app in create_app below
        whooshee = Whooshee()

        def create_app():
            app = Flask(__name__)

            db.init_app(app)
            whooshee.init_app(app)
            return app

        @whooshee.register_model('text')
        class Article(db.Model):
            id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
            text = db.Column(db.UnicodeText)


.. versionchanged:: 0.4.0
    The ``init_app`` function now works properly with multiple Flask application objects.

.. versionadded:: development
    Added ``WHOOSHEE_MEMORY_STORAGE`` config variable.


How It Works
------------

Flask-Whooshee is based on so-called whoosheers. These represent Whoosh indexes
and are responsible for indexing new/updated fields. There are two types
of whoosheers. The simple *model whoosheers*, that indexes fields from just
one index::

    @whooshee.register_model('title', 'content')
    class Entry(db.Model):
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        title = db.Column(db.String)
        content = db.Column(db.Text)

This will make the columns ``title`` and ``content`` searchable.

For more advanced use cases you can create your own custom whoosheers
which will allow you to create indexes and search across multiple tables.
Create them like this::

    from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
    from flask_whooshee import Whooshee, AbstractWhoosheer

    class User(db.Model):
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        name = db.Column(db.String)

    # you can still keep the model whoosheer
    @whooshee.register_model('title', 'content')
    class Entry(db.Model):
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        title = db.Column(db.String)
        content = db.Column(db.Text)
        user = db.relationship(User, backref=db.backref('entries'))
        user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'))


Now we create a custom whoosheer class which we will use to update the
``User`` and ``Entry`` indexes::

    @whooshee.register_whoosheer
    class EntryUserWhoosheer(AbstractWhoosheer):
        # create schema, the unique attribute must be in form of
        # model.__name__.lower() + '_' + 'id' (name of model primary key)
        schema = whoosh.fields.Schema(
            entry_id = whoosh.fields.NUMERIC(stored=True, unique=True),
            user_id = whoosh.fields.NUMERIC(stored=True),
            username = whoosh.fields.TEXT(),
            title = whoosh.fields.TEXT(),
            content = whoosh.fields.TEXT())

        # don't forget to list the included models
        models = [Entry, User]

        # create insert_* and update_* methods for all models
        # if you have camel case names like FooBar,
        # just lowercase them: insert_foobar, update_foobar
        @classmethod
        def update_user(cls, writer, user):
            pass  # TODO: update all users entries

        @classmethod
        def update_entry(cls, writer, entry):
            writer.update_document(entry_id=entry.id,
                                   user_id=entry.user.id,
                                   username=entry.user.name,
                                   title=entry.title,
                                   content=entry.content)

        @classmethod
        def insert_user(cls, writer, user):
            pass  # nothing, user doesn't have entries yet

        @classmethod
        def insert_entry(cls, writer, entry):
            writer.add_document(entry_id=entry.id,
                                user_id=entry.user.id,
                                username=entry.user.name,
                                title=entry.title,
                                content=entry.content)

        @classmethod
        def delete_user(cls, writer, user):
            pass  # TODO: delete all users entries

        @classmethod
        def delete_entry(cls, writer, entry):
            writer.delete_by_term('entry_id', entry.id)


To register all whoosheers in one place, just call the
:meth:`Whooshee.register_whoosheer` method like this::

    whooshee.register_whoosheer(EntryUserWhoosheer)


Writing Queries
---------------

After the whoosheers have been registered, you can leverage the query_class
provided by Whooshee and write queries like this::

    # will find entries whose title or content matches 'chuck norris'
    Entry.query.\
        whooshee_search('chuck norris').\
        order_by(Entry.id.desc()).\
        all()

You can even join queries and search them like this
(using the advanced example from above)::

    # will find any joined entry<->query,
    # whose User.name or Entry.title or Entry.content
    # matches 'chuck norris'
    Entry.query.join(User).\
        whooshee_search('chuck norris').\
        order_by(Entry.id.desc()).\
        all()


The whoosheer that is used for searching is, by default, selected based on
the models participating in the query. This set of models is compared against
the value of `models` attribute of each registered whoosheer and the one
with an exact match is selected. You can override this behaviour by explicitly
passing whoosheer that should be used for searching to the
:meth:`WhoosheeQuery.whooshee_search` method. This is useful if you don't
want to join on all the models that form the search index. For example::

    Entry.query.\
        whooshee_search('chuck norris', whoosheer=EntryUserWhoosheer).\
        order_by(Entry.id.desc()).\
        all()

If there exists an entry of a user called 'chuck norris', this entry will be
found because the custom whoosheer, that contains field `username`,
will be used. But without the whoosheer option, that entry won't be found
(unless it has 'chuck&nbsp;norris' in content or title) because the
model whoosheer will be used.


Search Result Ordering
######################

By default only first 10 (for optimization reasons) search results are
sorted by relevance. You can modify this behaviour by explicitly setting
the value of `order_by_relevance` parameter of the `whooshee_search` method.

Return all search results sorted by relevance (only Chuck Norris can do this)::

    Entry.query.join(User).\
        whooshee_search('chuck norris', order_by_relevance=-1).\
        all()

Return first 25 rows sorted by their relevance::

    Entry.query.join(User).\
        whooshee_search('chuck norris', order_by_relevance=25).\
        all()

Disable sorting altogether::

    Entry.query.join(User).\
        whooshee_search('chuck norris', order_by_relevance=0).\
        all()


Reindexing
----------

If you lost your search index data and you need to recreate it or you are
introducing Flask-Whooshee to an existing application and need to index
already existing data, you can use the :meth:`Whooshee.reindex` method to
reindex your data::

    from flask_whooshee import Whooshee
    whooshee = Whooshee(app)
    whooshee.reindex()

.. versionadded::  v0.0.9

Manual index updates
--------------------

If your application depends heavily on write operations and
there are lots of concurrent search-index updates, you might want
opt for a cron job invoking :meth:`whooshee.reindex()` periodically
instead of employing the default index auto-updating mechanism.

To disable index auto updating, set ``auto_update`` class property of
a Whoosheer to ``False``::

    @whooshee.register_whoosheer
    class NewEntryUserWhoosheer(EntryUserWhoosheer):
        auto_update = False

.. versionadded::  v0.5.0

Enabling/disabling indexing
---------------------------

By setting the configuration option ``WHOOSHEE_ENABLE_INDEXING`` to
``False``, you can turn of any operations with the Whoosh index
(creating, updating and deleting entries). This can be useful e.g.
when mass-importing large amounts of entries for testing purposes,
but you don't actually need the whooshee fulltext search for
these tests to pass.

Note, that once the ``Whooshee(app)`` call is done, the value of this
configuration setting can only be changed by using
``app.extensions['whooshee']['enable_indexing'] = <value>`` (where
``value`` is either ``True`` or ``False``).

.. versionadded::  v0.5.0

Changelog
---------

0.5.0
#####

* Added configuration option ``WHOOSHEE_ENABLE_INDEXING`` that allows
  turning off indexing (useful when importing large test sets that
  don't require indexing in order to actually execute the tests).

  on Python 2.7.
* Python 2.6 is no longer officially supported, although flask-whooshee
  should keep working on it.
* Added the option to do manual index updates (through
  ``AbstractWhoosheer.auto_update`` attribute).

0.4.1
#####

* SQLAlchemy's aliased entities are now recognized by ``whooshee_search``.
* Added support for ``RamStorage``. Can be enabled by setting
  ``WHOOSHEE_MEMORY_STORAGE`` to ``True``.
